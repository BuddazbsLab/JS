Let's start with the definition of what [javascript] is.

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a programming language initially designed to interact with elements of web pages. In web browsers, JavaScript consists of three main parts:

- ECMAScript that provides the core functionality.
- The [Document Object Model (DOM)](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-dom/), which provides interfaces for interacting with elements on web pages
- The [Browser Object Model (BOM)](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-bom/), which provides API for interacting with web browsers.

JavaScript allows you to add interactivity to a web page. It is often used with HTML and CSS to enhance the functionality of a web page such as validating forms, creating interactive maps, and displaying animated charts.

When a web page is loaded i.e. after HTML and CSS have been downloaded, the JavaScript engine in the web browser executes the JavaScript code. The JavaScript code then modifies the HTML and CSS to dynamically update the user interface.

**Client-side vs. Server-side JavaScript**

When JavaScript is used on a web page, it is executed in the web browsers of user’s computers. In this case, JavaScript works as a client-side language.

JavaScript can run on both web browsers and servers. A popular server-side environment for JavaScript is Node.js. Unlike the client-side JavaScript, the server-side JavaScript executes on the server that allows you to access databases, file systems, etc.

Well, then. We learned a little about what JS is and then the material will be replenished as we master it😊

____
Well, it was already mastered 3 lessons on JavaScript.
the first classes were quite simple and we managed it. But already from the 3rd lesson it becomes more difficult. The actual lessons learned are below, and the homework itself is inside.

1) The basics of the language JavaScript 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
2) Basic JavaScript Operators 😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️
3) Loops, arrays, and data structures  😰😰😰😰😰😰😰
